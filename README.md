# Network science-based for identifying novel functional protein complexes in breast cancer

This project brings a network science-based method to identify novel functional protein complexes that can be used as therapeutic targets in breast cancer therapy.

## Files

### `file_downloder.sh`

This shell script allows the download of all the useful file that are required in the `breast_cancer.ipynb` notebook for tthe analysis.

### `breast_cancer.ipynb`

This notebook contains all the code performing the human protein interactome for the analysis in the context of breast cancer, providing plots and results.

### `work_report.pdf`

A comprehensive report that describes the methodologies, and discusses the results obtained from the study.

## Notes

The `file_downloder.sh` file downloads all the elements in a `datasets` folder, that is automatically made if not already present. The files are not shown here, due to upload size limits.
